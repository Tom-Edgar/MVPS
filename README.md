Manimgl files for MVP YouTube Channel

Here I will place code from some of my videos at https://www.youtube.com/c/MicroVisualProofs/ . I cannot guarantee every video's code will eventually make it here, but I will work to increase the availability of code. I intend for this to be a learning repository for those interested in learning Manim and creating their own animations.

All of the code so far has been compiled using manimgl; I am not sure how they will run under manimce. For more information about Manim, see https://www.manim.community/.
